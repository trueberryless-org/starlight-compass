# `starlight-compass` 🧭

Starlight plugin to review your documentation with typed AI decisions.

## Features

- **Reviews while you write.** The Astro dev toolbar reviews the page you are viewing, and opt-in audits fail pull requests in CI.
- **Nine rules.** Classify pages with [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr), rate them against quality rubrics, find duplicates, check titles, descriptions, tags, topics, sidebar placement and blog posts, and find unfinished content.
- **Typed decisions.** Rules ask yes-or-no, multiple choice and scoring questions instead of generating text, so findings are reliable enough to fail a build.
- **Your choice of model.** Use TypeSafe's Jev, any OpenAI-compatible service or local model, or your own provider.
- **For readers.** Documentation type badges, a sparkle button to ask the docs that links to matching pages without generating answers, and feedback triage.
